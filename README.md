# Oceanic Next Modified for Sublime Text

I love the `Agila Oceanic Next` theme except for one thing, **JavaScript object keys**.

Currently, `Agila Oceanic Next` colors object keys the same shade of green as it does strings. This makes objects with many strings as values look very confusing. I made a modification to the theme that instead styles them with the yellow color found in the `JSON - Level 1` syntax.

Hope this helps. Enjoy!
