# Oceanic Next Modified for Sublime Text

I love the `Agila Oceanic Next` theme except for one thing, **JavaScript object keys**.

Currently, `Agila Oceanic Next` colors object keys the same shade of green as it does strings. This makes objects with many strings as values look very confusing. I made a modification to the theme that instead styles them with the yellow color found in the `JSON - Level 1` syntax.

Hope this helps. Enjoy! 

## Installation

The details of the installation are up to you. Here are some options:

1. Copy/paste this theme over the top of your current `Agila Oceanic Next` theme.
2. Clone the repo, symlink the theme file to your Package folder (that's what I'm doing).
3. Manually place the file in the correct folder.

You've got this!
